Project Objectives
Clean and organize the data.
Perform a statistical summary of the sales data.
Visualize the patterns through charts.

Steps Taken
1. Removal of Duplicates
Removed duplicate transactions using the Remove Duplicates feature in Excel.
Ensured that the analyzed data was unique.
2. Data Cleaning
The Date column was formatted correctly to ensure consistency, displaying dates in the DD/MM/YYYY format.
Numeric Columns like item_price, quantity, and transaction_amount were converted to number format to enable accurate calculations.
3. Creation of New Columns for Date Analysis
The date column was split into Day, Month, and Year using Text to Columns.
A new column was created to combine Month and Year for broader time-based analyses.

Total Revenue: sum of all transactions.
Top-Selling Item: analysis of the total quantity sold for each item.
Revenue by Item Category: comparison between Fastfood and Beverages.
Number of Transactions by Payment Type: analysis of transactions made via Cash and Online Payments.
5. Data Visualization
Charts were created in Excel to represent the patterns found in the data:

Bar Chart showing the top-selling items.
Pie Chart comparing payment methods (Cash vs. Online).
Line Chart showing the evolution of sales over time.
Column Chart comparing revenue by item category (Fastfood vs. Beverages).
6. Date Grouping
Grouped dates by Month to improve visualization and reduce noise in time-based charts.
